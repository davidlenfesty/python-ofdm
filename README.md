# Python-OFDM

## Introduction

This is a small program/simulation/whatever meant to emulate an OFDM modem.
This is the pilot work for creating an underwater communications system for ARVP.
Eventually I want to put this on an FPGA. (will it fit on an iCE40 I wonder?)

## OFDM Background ##

### TODO

I should write stuff down here to help solidify my mental model of OFDM, but for now, you get nothing.
